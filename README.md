# OCC Contract Adjustment Alert Bot

This Discord bot provides a suite of financial utilities designed to monitor corporate actions like reverse stock splits and help users stay informed about the stock market. It offers live stock price fetching, options intrinsic value calculation, and both **OCC** and **SEC** monitoring for reverse stock split memos. Additionally, the bot can track the server's health and provide insights on server membership.

## Features

- **üìà Live Stock Price Fetching**: Retrieve the most up-to-date stock prices during market hours, or the last available price after hours using the `yfinance` API.
  
- **üí° Intrinsic Value Calculation**: Calculate the intrinsic value of **call** or **put** options contracts. The bot takes into account the current stock price and strike price to determine whether the option has any inherent value.

- **üìë OCC Memo Monitoring**: The bot constantly checks the **OCC (Options Clearing Corporation)** RSS feed for memos related to **reverse stock splits**. Whenever a new memo is found, it sends an alert in a specified Discord channel, ensuring you never miss crucial corporate adjustments.

- **üì∞ SEC Filing Monitoring**: The bot also monitors the **SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)** RSS feed for new filings, alerting users when relevant documents‚Äîsuch as those mentioning reverse stock splits‚Äîare published. It provides direct links to the SEC's filing pages.

- **üñ•Ô∏è Server Health Monitoring**: Track your server's health with real-time updates on **CPU usage**, **memory usage**, **disk usage**, **uptime**, and even **component temperatures** (useful for monitoring Raspberry Pi or other hardware).

- **üë• User Count**: The bot can also provide the number of users currently in the Discord server.
